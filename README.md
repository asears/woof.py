> Spend the month of November writing code that generates a novel of 50k+ words.

The rules say:

> The "novel" is defined however you want. It could be 50,000 repetitions of the word "meow". It could literally grab a random novel from Project Gutenberg. It doesn't matter, as long as it's 50k+ words.

Well, someone had better create 50,000 meows just to get it out of the way.

But this isn't just "meow" 50,000 times. meow.py replaces all words with a meow of the same length, keeping punctuation.

Usage:

`python meow.py infile.txt > outfile.txt"

Here's the above rule put through meow.py:

> Mew "meeow" me meeooow meoooow mew meow. Me meeow me me,mew meeeeeoooow me mew meow "meow". Me meoow meeeeeoow meow m meooow meoow meow Meeooow Meeeeeoow. Me meoow'm meooow, me meow me me'm mew+ meoow.
